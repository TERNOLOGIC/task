Ternologic Project front-end. (Mahmoud's Ihmaid Solution)
I used a `json-server` to generate a fake backend, it's not as a npm package. you can run it as npx.

# Installation & Running:
Install packages
```bash
npm install
```
Running a fake server to fetch the data on port `3004`
```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```
Running the application
```bash
npm start
```
